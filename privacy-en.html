            <h3>üîí Privacy First</h3>
            <p><strong>Template Master is a completely offline desktop application that prioritizes your privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Data We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>Template Master does not collect any data from you, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses)</li>
            <li>Document content or templates you create</li>
            <li>Usage statistics or analytics</li>
            <li>Device information or system data</li>
            <li>Network activity or internet browsing data</li>
            <li>Any other personal or sensitive information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Template Master Works</h2>
        <p>Template Master is a standalone desktop application that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Works completely offline</strong> - no internet connection required</li>
            <li><strong>Processes documents locally</strong> - all your files stay on your computer</li>
            <li><strong>Stores templates openly</strong> - all templates and data are saved in readable formats on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Does not communicate externally</strong> - the application never sends data over the internet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since Template Master operates entirely offline:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your documents and templates never leave your computer</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted to our servers or any third parties</li>
            <li>You have complete control over all files created by the application</li>
            <li>All generated documents remain solely in your possession</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Template Master does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics tools, or external APIs. The application functions independently without any external dependencies.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Since Template Master does not collect any data, this privacy policy is unlikely to change. However, if we ever update the application to include optional features that might involve data handling, we will update this policy and notify users accordingly.</p>
