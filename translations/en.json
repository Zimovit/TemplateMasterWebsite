    "1st": "Imagine that you need to type the text for dozens of greeting cards, changing only the names and addresses. Or maybe you are sending out wedding invitations? Or you need to send a multi-page legal document to hundreds of recipients, making dozens of edits in each copy. Boring routine work. This is exactly what machines are for.",
    "2nd": "With the Template Master application, you only need a document template and a spreadsheet with data for replacements. You can read how to create a template in the instructions by clicking the corresponding button in the program. The program can generate the header for the spreadsheet itself, you will only have to enter the data.",
    "3rd": "If you need to generate one document, and you have a template, the program can do this too. Currently, Template Master can work with DOCX and ODT documents, as well as XLSX and ODS spreadsheets. And, it is also a completely free application."
